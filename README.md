## rbxminimapmodule
A high-performance modular minimap system for Roblox, built for both casual games and competitive experiences.
## Features:
 - A switch between MiniMap V2 and V3
 - Real-time player tracking with direction arrow and player camera direction
 - Ragdoll syncing support (yes it works now ðŸ’€)

## How it works
Uses `ViewportFrame` with camera tracking, smart model cloning, and per-frame updates.
## Installation
1. Copy `minimap.client.lua` into a LocalScript inside a ScreenGui.
2. Make sure to set up:
   - `ViewerFolder` in Workspace
   - `ViewerFolder2` in ReplicatedStorage
   - `TrackRagdoll` RemoteEvent
3. Customize `mapCenter` and other settings in the script.

## Demo Place
Use `MiniMapDemo.rbxl` to see everything in action.
